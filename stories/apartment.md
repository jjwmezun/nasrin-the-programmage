## I

Nasrin spent most o’ the summer months looking for a new apartment, & after countless wasted hours on scarce days off riding buses forth & back to & from complexes only to find false leads or to have them ne’er get back to them after sending in their application, Nasrin had begun to doubt they’d e’er find a new apartment & was prepping to ship off all their stuff to ’neath Baguette Bridge, where they would have to make their new home; howe’er, then, as if by fate, they had received in the mail they rarely used a letter advertising a new apartment complex called “Happy Homes” to them without any solicitation from them. They guessed that it was sent from 1 o’ the apartment-search websites they had needed to sign up for to send out applications & had forgotten to uncheck — or wasn’t allowed to uncheck — the agreement that allowed them to send them spam for eternity, but didn’t see their logo anywhere on the advertisement. Either way, they estimated whate’er this apartment was was likely better than living under a bridge, — specially with how nice it looked, according to the satellite images on Mapper — & the price it had for the 1 free studio apartment they had was far from the worst they’d seen for that size. But to err on the side o’ caution, they looked online for whate’er reviews they could find. While the average was 5 stars, that part o’ the human brain that preferred to focus on the negative led them, as it always did, to look @ the 1-star reviews. These few reviews were short, badly-spelled, ungrammatical complaints complaining that their apartment was haunted & for some reason the people who ran the complex didn’t believe them & refused to let them out o’ their lease penalty-free. Judging that that was as good a reassurance they could get in this market economy still lacking perfect information, Nasrin immediately started filling out the application so they’d be able to send it out the next morn, which was the best effort they could take to avoid letting someone else snatch the last studio apartment.

Nasrin was shocked to get a phone call from Happy Homes the evening o’ the day just after the day they’d sent out their application. { I had no idea the mail traveled that quickly }. The cheery fellow on the other end directed them to a website where they could fully complete their application, which unfortunately required typing in just ’bout everything they’d written in the application, but which also included all the information needed to finalize the lease, such as licenses, pay stubs, & a much mo’ expensive deposit. By the end o’ the week Happy Homes called ’gain & they scheduled a visit the Saturday o’ tomorrow to sign the rest o’ the forms & to receive their keys.

Despite being officially fall, the weather still felt like being summer on the afternoon Nasrin arrived on the site o’ Happy Homes, with a heavy sun making the leaves still glow lime green on the maples. Still, Nasrin could see a few early escapist leaves lying on the pavement auguring autumn. After they filled out the final paperwork & received their keys, they wandered round the lot looking for the building labeled “I”. For as cost-effective as this apartment was, the area was nice, with plenty o’ large fields o’ grass & a variety o’ trees, from maples to firs to e’en some cherry blossoms.

After wandering in a few circles, they finally found the building labeled “I” & spied the # “202” on the upper right door. { I hope Sabbath doesn’t have trouble with these stairs }, they thought as they climbed the steps.

They braced themself as they unlocked the door, momentarily musing on the possibility o’ the key not working. Howe’er, not only did the key work, but ’pon coming inside & looking round, they found li’l to complain ’bout, save for maybe the small size o’ the kitchen & the water heater in the closet. They exhaled in relief & then walked back out & shut & locked the door.

## II

Nasrin wandered their now-deceased father’s house that had, till now, been their own, not to gather 1 last nostalgic taste before it became discontinued, but in search for something that had that particular quality o’ being worthless but unique. Finally their mind, not their eyes, offered the idea o’ a receipt, which would, ’course, be specific to that particular visit to FredMart: they rummaged thru their recycling basket till they found the 1 from their stop after their trip home from their visit to their new home & carried it o’er to their nightstand, next to their new invention — a needle with a small black plastic shell for feet.

They picked up this needle & held it o’er the receipt, only to realize that it may not be the best specimen, after all. { If I try jabbing this into this, it’ll just rip thru & won’t send the data }.

{ This’ll be a good test for if this will work for extremely thin objects like paper or if I’ll need a better way to carry out data transmission }.

They leaned forward & pressed the needle up to the receipt without impaling & dug down as slowly & gently as they could till they saw the 1st sign o’ fluffy tearing round the needle. While still holding the needle, they raised it & the receipt both & looked under the receipt to see that the needle hadn’t broken thru the other side. Assured so, Nasrin lowered them both onto their nightstand & turned the needle so that its plastic casing showed its cheap LED screen, only for Nasrin to remember that they forgot their notebook. They rummaged thru their books sandwiched ’tween the top surface & base o’ their nightstand till they found their starry-sky-covered notebook & flipped to the last page with ink on it. With this page opened to them they read the 3 coordinates they had written down during their visit @ their apartment & typed them into the # pad next to their LED. Once every # was put in, they double checked the LED & the notebook to ensure they were perfectly = before pressing the “Enter” button. After they had confirmed that the 3rd # matched they lingered o’er the “Enter” button & held their breath for a moment before finally pressing down. The next instant they no longer saw the receipt in front o’ them. Tho this wasn’t e’en the 1st time they tested this new invention out, they still felt it eerie how suddenly their subject moves, without noise or tactual feedback.

Then they stood up & went out to take a bus ride back to their new apartment, still high from the excitement that they couldn’t concentrate on the book they tried to read. Mo’ impatient to finally get the answer to their question than a present-hungry child waiting for Marxmas to arrive, they practically ran the ~1km distance from their last bus stop to their apartment, scrambling up the steps so fast that they knew they would stumble & injure their knees. They didn’t, howe’er; & when they unlocked & opened their door they found a small piece o’ paper waiting in the middle o’ the empty floor. They picked it up & confirmed that ’twas the same receipt & e’en had the same tiny shred marks from where they jabbed the needle into it.

But rather than fill them with the assurance they’d expected, it only left their many smaller questions they would need to resolve regarding how well this would work for other things. If Nasrin had learned anything from their studies, it’s that the Programmers coded this world as if they rushed it while sleep-deprived & snorting coke: there was li’l consistency & data & functions were bloated with arcane exceptions. Also, ’cause this was 1 o’ the earliest life-like earth simulation o’ its kind1 ( ¡the 1st computer that ran it wasn’t e’en a quantum computer! ), the Programmers had to worry ’bout keeping this realm’s code efficient ( despite Rust already being the standard @ the time, the Programmers still used C, without any form o’ memory protection ) & small ( ’twas still only ’bout 2 exabytes, & its 1st release was only ’bout 256 petabytes, which are tiny compared to modern realities, which are usually hundreds to thousands o’ EB ), which meant they went mo’ low-level than mo’ modern realities, which, combined with the Programmers’ sloppiness, led to a lack o’ real data checking, causing abnormalities to happen all o’er the place.

Foremost, they couldn’t keep out o’ their mind the devious idea o’ using their “warp needle”, as they called it, on themself — an idea that nearly stopped their heart as dangerous as it sounded. { I have to try it on a human @ some point, & trying it on someone else would be unethical… }. But then they remembered that they’d ne’er written down their ol’ home’s coordinates, nor had they taken their needle with them, so they knew they’d a’least have to wait till they took the bus back to their ol’ home.

## III

Fear o’ the uncertain hung o’er Nasrin all the while they used their needle on each o’ their possessions, with no way to know whether everything reached their new home intact till they’d finished everything & took a bus there with their cats ( for they still didn’t feel up to trying their needle on themself, much mo’ their precious cats ). To add to the complication, Nasrin quickly realized — tho not as quickly as to have figured it out while still @ their new home & able to make multiple coordinate recordings — that they couldn’t transport every 1 o’ their possessions in the exact same spot without having them telefrag each other into pieces, so they had to estimate adjustments for the large items, keeping a spreadsheet to note exactly where they put each possession & offsetting the next by the size o’ the previous item, rounding up & adding maybe half a meter or so for leeway. While they didn’t calculate coordinates for each edge, they did know that their apartment’s livingroom area was 3 by 2.5 meters & that the coordinate they did have was near the middle. Unfortunately, they had no idea how these dimensions lined up with the X & Y axis, — they certainly couldn’t guarantee an aligned rectangle — so they treated the space they could be sure o’ as a 2.5 meter radius circle.

The other hitch they ran into was that some drawers & boxes — but only some for some reason — when transported would leave many o’ their contents to immediately fall onto the ground from where the drawers or boxes had been, meaning these possessions’ positions were manually set to inside their holder ( & now realizing they were no longer in their holders, surrendered to the gravity o’ the outer holder, the apartment ), while the items that did get transported apparently had some code that treated their position as relative to their holders’, & thus were dragged ’long with their holders. This concerned them mo’ for the contents that did warp, as they had no idea if their position data ( which surely still existed as it existed on any concrete object ) would automatically adjust or if these things were in some freakishly inconsistent state where ’twas in 2 places @ once & if any interaction will make them suddenly warp back to their ol’ home or if every possible interaction with them had moved to their new location or if this list o’ all possibilities was split in some ’way ’mong its dual locations. They felt round where they’d transported a box with contents they knew they saw go with it to see if they could still feel any o’ these contents lingering round — in case only their appearance kept relative to the box & not any other facet, or e’en if they just didn’t appear when the box was closed, regardless o’ whether its location was still truly inside the box. Howe’er, for all the times they checked, they ne’er felt anything that couldn’t be seen.

{ I knew this was a bad idea. I truly have no idea what kind o’ corruption I am doing to all my things. ¿Why couldn’t I just keep my tests to valueless things & just stop being a cheapo & hire a moving truck like a normal person? }.

## IV

Nasrin was happy to be using their stored-up vacation days & to have shortened hours, despite the hit on their savings, which had already taken a bit o’ a hit after paying their deposit, specially round the beginning o’ October, when the dry, frustratingly hot days became cooler & when the days became mo’ colorful & exotic, the nights ’live with sounds o’ owls & singing wind & gnarled trees, which they couldn’t see, but knew were there all the same; but they was less happy with fears that they was wasting yet ’nother autumn accomplishing nothing. They would plan to engorge themself on a hefty volume of ol’ horror films, novels, short stories, video games, music, you name it — far mo’ than they could swallow — only to turn ’way from them so quickly like modern vampires from sunlight with weary eyes & to prefer lying in bed in the darkness. The reality kept clubbing them on the head that they had outgrown their illusions & had grown bored with the artificiality o’ it all, like outgrowing the taste o’ McCheesy’s plastic burgers — probably ’cause these illusions & this artificiality was what they had built their whole life on. They would stare out the window @ the soothing music o’ the aftermidnight rain & wonder why they couldn’t go outside & feel it for themself, to let the lightning strike them like the bolts on Adam’s neck. 

Laziness, that was the sickness that had left them mo’ infirm than many with far worse physical ailments. They quailed as they thought ’bout what an effort ’twas just to move from 1 home to ’nother, something any other mortal would not e’en think ’bout — what a struggle ’twas to wake up in the morn, or e’en late afternoon after 9 hours o’ sleep, despite also feeling the tremors o’ excess energy inside them. Laziness, the ultimate sin. ¿What sin could be worse? ¿Greed? In the year o’ our current lord, not God, but the US $, being insufficiently greedy was probably a far greater sin than being greedy. ¿Lust? ’Twas the very thing that kept humanity ’live, thanks to that vengeful god, natural selection. ¿Gluttony? ¿You mean the very thing that fueled the economy’s demand? Nonsense. ¿Pride? Rather, those who have no self-respect are mo’ broken. ¿Envy? ¿Is every inventor who wants to be the next Edison bad for the world? ¿Is every musician who wants to be the next Beatles bad for the world? Rather those without ambition are bad for the world. ¿Wrath? Nasrin laughed. It amazed them that a people who claimed to believe in a work as angry & violent as the Bible could pretend to be gainst wrath. If wrath were evil, than truly no one was eviler than Yahweh & his followers who daily throw stones @ all the devils who roam the world.

No, all the world’s religions, both mystical & materialist, whether they be Christian priests or Buddhist monks, or capitalist tycoons or communist bureaucrats, all agree on the great evil that is laziness. ¿Why else would the world dedicate so much to the creation & maintenance o’ computers, a tool dedicated entirely to fixing humanity’s laziness? & yet, humanity always somehow finds mo’ work that needs to be done, & thus mo’ reasons for laziness to be the greatest o’ sins.

They kept closing & opening the window, kept covering themself with their 5 blankets, & then throwing them off in a heavy sweat, & then tried only 3 or 2 blankets, only to spin the cycle ’gain with all 5 blankets. In their mind they was standing underground, holding onto a wooden beam, & could e’en feel the roughness o’ the wood, could feel, taste, & smell the vapor that seeped in where the thick raindrops could not. They had eaten what was probably a bad pot pie — which also had chicken in it, since their lazy inability to do what they “wanted” to do extended just as much to the avoidance o’ eating the flesh from their brethren in the animal kingdom — & had hoped it would give them visions; but it only made them feel cramps in their stomach & @ 1 point feel the bolus o’ possible vomit rise to their throat. They made the unwise decision to take a few swigs from their bottle o’ their oily black octopus rum, but felt no warmth spread from it: only the chill o’ deep loneliness that no blanket could bulwark gainst — or people, for that matter, for they had long been disabused o’ the illusionary cliché “you are not ’lone” ( & would prefer to be ’lone from the kind o’ buffoons who regurgitate such twaddle, anyway ).

& with this sickness came the creeping stirrings for death: to imagine themself a ghost able to haunt a great big exploratory mansion for eternity, free from the weakness o’ their body & the feebleness o’ their ADD-riddled mind, floating ’bove the laziness that tied their mortal corpse down from its full potential, from the shakiness, the dizziness, the heart palpitations, or their weak lungs like a cage round all fresh air that distracted them. But they knew death would not lead to a greater afterlife, but to that e’en greater evil than laziness: — tho it comes from laziness — nothingness. So they slapped their own face in the futile attempt to stir themself.

They looked back out the window @ the flashing lights o’ the lightning & felt the thunder rumble under them. As always the scent o’ disaster was in the air, the danger that would finally prematurely end every endeavor they was lingering too far o’er; & torn by such turbulent allegiances, they could only stare with wide-eyed curiosity.

The next Saturday’s outside air held such a heft o’ fantastic fog that Nasrin knew they had to finally get off their ass & go meet it. So they contrived the ’scuse o’ wrapping a leash round young Maple — named for its calico coloring farrago o’ coffee browns, tans, blacks, & whites — & taking them for a walk round the short grassy yard ’tween the colonnade o’ buildings & the parking lot & took the 1st turn thru the dry-dirt alley ’tween them & the neighboring buildings toward the back. This trip went @ a slow, jerky pace as Maple felt the need to stop @ every pile o’ twigs or gathering o’ li’l orange pine leaves to interrogate them, which was fine for Nasrin, as it gave them the ’scuse to stop & stare up @ the tiny black birds that flew thru the sky & the fence o’ fir sentinels guarding every horizon that wasn’t completely blocked off by buildings, all pallored like zombies under the tapestry o’ fog. Meanwhile, their black Sabbath, who was ol’ & experienced ’nough to roam the wilderness by himself, followed them @ a safe distance as if investigating why his 2 roommates were invading his new prairie. ’Ventually they made it to the back to be greeted by a large maple with its palmate children o’ yellows, reds, oranges, browns, & blacks lying @ its feet, which the cat named Maple, naturally, had to investigate. Once they had learned all that they needed to learn from this tree, they led Nasrin eastward thru the grassy field in the least efficient route possible, down into a bowl full o’ dried orange leaves, & then up to & ’long the black iron fence that separated their apartment complex from ’nother, only to stop  on a gray iron plate on a short hill with a barred off storm drain, sniffing the dark brown air inside, which Maple was particularly fascinated by. Nasrin could see why, tho: e’en their inferior human nose could smell an unexpectedly pleasant smell o’ burning hickory, as if from a BBQ grill, which seemed to come from this storm drain. They wondered if they just imagined that it came from down there & looked up & round them to see if there was any smoke that would reveal the culprit. Then they quickly realized that, since ’twas foggy, they wouldn’t be able to see smoke, anyway. Howe’er, that didn’t stop them from stopping to admire the firs in the distance ’gain.

What did stop them was the sudden shriek that blasted from ’hind them — so loud that it knocked them to the ground. They swung round to face whate’er was ’hind them only to see nothing there. Then they remembered Maple & looked round them only to see to their horror that the leash was no longer in their hands. They stood & swung their head round to see if they could find Maple still out in the open, only to look down ’pon hearing the sound o’ feline footsteps below. They leaned down toward the storm drain & called out, <¡Maple!>, but the only reply they heard was mo’ walking.

Nasrin cursed & began to yank desperately on the bars o’ the storm drain, e’en tho they knew it’d be no use, only to be surprised when they felt the storm drain face yank right off. They gazed down into the dark brown hole, thinking for a brief moment, { I don’t want my best sweat pants to be stained with the permanent stench o’ fecal matter }, only to respond to themself with, { I’m sure I’ll be able to wash it out — & I can always buy ’nother pair. Maple could get lost or drown down here }. So they slid down the length which they learned with the harder-than-expected landing was longer than it seemed & looked ’head to see a hallway stretch before them, tall ’nough to walk thru without crouching.

@ the end o’ the tunnel they saw a door open a 3rd o’ the way, with music that sounded somewhat like cabaret, but fuzzy & crunchy like from an ol’ computer, gradually get louder as they neared the door. & as the door grew in proximity, they felt the familiar clamminess o’ ambivalence.

{ I know I heard Maple walking down here }.

{ It could’ve been a rat… or maybe e’en a person }.

{ I would’ve seen Maple out in the yard if they weren’t down here. This is the only place they could’ve hid into that quickly }. They grabbed the doorknob. { Anyway, if a worker’s down here & gets irate with me, I’ll just say I’m looking for my cat & think it went down here. It’s not as if they can arrest you for something like that }.

But when they opened the door they didn’t find a work room full o’ pipes & equipment, as they expected, but a brick-walled basement with posters o’ musicians & the kind o’ furniture you’d find in an apartment. As their eyes glided ’long the dressers & laundry hampers, they stopped on the bronze gramophone spinning a record that seemed to be producing the music they heard & next to that sitting a young man reaching out a hand toward Maple, who was eating something too tiny for Nasrin to make out. The young man, whose black jeans & orange hoodie seemed both too casual & too clean to be the apparel o’ someone currently @ work, was looking @ them.

<¿Is this your cat?>, he asked.

Gainst the dryness that afflicted their throat, Nasrin said, <Yes. I think he must’ve been scared by a noise outside>. Their hand moved to reach up & brush a bang that suddenly felt thick on their forehead, but they forced it back down. <I’m sorry ’bout the inconvenience>.

<It’s no problem. I like cats, & this 1’s very sweet>. The young man turned to Maple & began rubbing its forehead & chin, which Maple accepted with closed eyes & a smug grin.

## VI

<Yeah>, Nasrin mumbled. Then, with the mental ’scuse o’ needing to be near their cat in case this stranger decided ’twas nice ’nough to keep, they forced themself to walk toward it gainst the heavy pounding o’ their heart & crouched down next to it to pet its back, while keeping the young man, whose knee was mere centimeters from hers, in the corner o’ their eye. As they stared @ all the lines on his jeans & the way they creased ’long his knee, they became conscious o’ the way their legs looked covered in baggy dark gray sweat pants with black tartan pattern, crouching so near.

<¿You live in these complexes?>, asked the young man.

Without moving their eyes, Nasrin said, <Yes. I just moved here last week>.

<¿You liking it here so far?>.

<Uh huh>.

<¿You live ’lone?>.

Gainst their will, Nasrin felt a flush rush to their face & a deep desire to snatch their cat & flee from this insidious question. @ 1st they had wanted to respond, “No, I live with 2 cats”, but then realized that sounded mo’ dumb than funny, so they just mumbled, <Yes>.

<I do, too. I was surprised by how affordable the prices on studio apartments was here>.

Nasrin nodded & continued to stare @ their hand, which began to feel the lightest o’ burns from what must’ve been mo’ than 100 rubs gainst Maple’s back — tho Maple’s face indicated that they was hardly any mo’ bored than when they received their 1st rub.

Nasrin ne’er liked small talk — or any talk, truly: it only distracted from their hobbies, was the equivalent o’ reading the schlockiest o’ airport novels or watching randos on YouTube — which, now that they thought ’bout it, they did do — when they could spend that time reading literary classics, & couldn’t accomplish anything but to give someone else the opportunity to be embarrassed for them & the lack o’ a life they has lived. They could, ’course, lie & make up stories o’ mountain climbing or fighting possessed rats or helping charities deliver medical supplies to sick kids in war-torn countries or that their job involved exploring subterranean caves using programmagic to rebuild pipes & thwart anthropomorphized bugs; ¿but what would be the point? If they did impress anyone else ’nough for them to stick round ( whose desirability was, by itself, debatable ), then they’d have to keep up the lies fore’er or admit they lied & turn them off completely. Thus Nasrin liked to hedge their bets & leave anyone they met @ a need-to-know basis in case @ some point they decided they did want to have a long-term relationship with them & would, presumably, devise a better plan in such circumstance.

But the long, breathless silence that hung o’er them here was e’en worse than small talk, so they forced themself to say, <¿What song is this?>.

<Neutra’s Requiem #3>.

<¿What instruments were they playing?>.

<Some instrument called the FamiTracker>.

<¿When was it composed?>.

<Some time in the 19th century, I think>.

Nasrin smiled & nodded with an <Mmm hmm> @ this man’s clear attempts @ flipping cups on them.

The young man began to sit up mo’ & said, <¿Can I get you anything? ¿Some tea?>.

Already feeling sweaty, Nasrin found the idea o’ such hot tea burning their tongue & the need to wait  for it to sluggishly cool as they waited here & had to endure mo’ small talk & trying not to be rude as to ogle this stranger’s legs spread out easily & not be able to touch anything & decided they needed to get out o’ here before they wet themself in this stranger’s home or acted any mo’ weird than they already had. So they said, <That’s very nice o’ you, but actually, I just remembered I need to get somewhere>. They picked up Maple & then forced themself to look @ the young man right in the face for the 1st time & said, <Thank you for the, uh, hospitality, & I’m sorry for whate’er intrusion I may have made>.

With a cool smile, the young man said, <It’s no intrusion, Madame. I like the company. Come round any time if you want>.

Nasrin nodded & said, <Thank you… Have a good day>, & then hurried out.

When they finished climbing back up the storm drain, — holding Maple as tightly to their chest as they could to prevent the li’l guy from frantically scrambling out o’ their grasp, as they was trying to do — Nasrin gasped in lungfuls o’ air. Then, wary that anyone else outside could be watching them, they scurried back to their apartment.

## VII

{ You’re dumb }.

Tho Nasrin had projects to work on & elements o’ programmagic to study, they was sitting in their office chair, rolling side to side.

{ He explicitly invited me to come back. He may e’en take it that I find him repulsive, when I’m truly just too lazy, if I don’t visit ’gain }.

{ It is a’least 10 meters there, tho — & thru the cold air }.

{ The exercise would do you good }.

{ So would not drinking wine or eating chocolate or playing video games or watching stupid shit on the internet }.

Nasrin yawned. This was why they ne’er accomplished anything: they kept getting distracted by these time-wasting dilemmas like whether they should take the bus down to the grocery store or wait till tomorrow & just eat ol’ canned soup buried somewhere in the back o’ their cupboard tonight.

{ We don’t e’en know this stranger.

## VIII

The next night Nasrin journeyed o’er to Spector’s home, ’twas raining hard with the crackle o’ thunder & the flash o’ lightning, which always made them feel good. They could imagine hearing it softened ’hind the walls o’ Spector’s room while they was warmed in 1 o’ his hairy arms while the other rubbed their knee.

When they reached his front door, they saw that ’twas already ajar, the light was on, & his streamophone was playing. They still didn’t feel comfortable just letting themself in, so they knocked, only to hear no answer. They waited for minutes, knocking every so oft, only to hear nothing still.

{ He can’t have gone anywhere }.

{ He may have just left the door open, maybe to let the air in, since he doesn’t seem to have any windows. Maybe he’s fallen asleep }.

{ I don’t think he’d mind if I just check in. I can apologize if not else — maybe just pretend that I’ve lost my cat ’gain }.

They slowly pushed the door open with their index & peeked inside till they had the door half open. Finally, they leaned their head inside & turned it all round to see Spector nowhere inside.

{ ¿Why would he just leave his door open if he’s out? ¿Doesn’t he care if anyone breaks in? }.

Nasrin felt a chill. They remembered that Spector didn’t care when they went into his home, e’en tho they could’ve been a robber or killer, regardless o’ how harmless they looked — nowadays the dorkiest-looking person in the world can kill you with a gun. They realized that Spector didn’t seem to e’er do much but sit round & listen to music, & they didn’t e’en know what he did for a living; & he was surprisingly glad to meet them & ne’er seemed to be with anyone else, despite seeming to have a much greater social grasp than they had & not seeming to have anything else to distract him from the work o’ meeting people. Plus, his apartment was almost barren & didn’t e’en seem to have a bed. All this pointed to 1 likely conclusion: Spector was probably depressed, perhaps deep ’nough to be semisuicidal, if he cared so li’l ’bout leaving his apartment open for anyone to steal or break things. Half o’ Nasrin felt for him, specially since they wasn’t full o’ vigor themself; but the ugly practical side o’ them fretted that this might drag them down e’en further than they does themself. ¿What would they do if he suddenly asked for money ’cause he couldn’t pay rent? They themself had finally stopped mooching off their father just a few years ago, so they couldn’t judge him differently… but they needed to save their money if they had a hope o’ retiring from their own menial job & focus full-time on their programmagic studies.

{ If I stopped screwing round & focused on my studies, maybe I’d figure out a way to use programmagic to make myself rich, & then I wouldn’t have to worry }.

As they considered this, they noticed that a pattern they’d seen on the wall looked a lot like a ladder, & then looked up & noticed a black square ’bove this pattern.

{ Maybe he is here. That’s probably where he sleeps. I should just leave & close the door ’hind me @ best }.

They jumped when they heard the door ’hind them slam. They swung round, dreading seeing Spector looking @ them furiously for breaking into his home, only to see nothing there @ all — just the front door, now closed.

{ ¿How’d the wind do that? }.

They walked up to the door & twisted the knob, only to find that it wouldn’t turn. They looked round the knob for locks or bolts, but found nothing but a circular pad with a keyhole. They began to twist & jiggle the knob in every way they could think o’ while yanking back, but the door wouldn’t budge from its frame.

Feeling their anxiety turn into hot anger, Nasrin steamed, { ¡What kind o’ fucking idiots make doors that only lock & unlock with a key from the inside? ¿How is that not a health-code violation? ¿What if the house caught on fire & a resident couldn’t find their key in time? }.

They took a deep breath, & then thought, { Well, I have no choice now but to wake Spector & ask him for the key. It’s letting myself get into stupid shit like this why it’s better for the whole world if I stop interacting with people }.

They climbed up the ladder, gritting their teeth @ how uneasy they felt with such thin bars, hanging on by just the tips o’ their toes & fingers. They was surprised they was able to make it to the top & not fall off & possibly break their neck. This new room was as dark as the black square foreboded, & Nasrin had no idea where a light switch was, so they had to suffice with the weak light o’ their phone till they found it on the wall nearest the opening.

After they flicked the switch, the new light revealed not a bedroom, but o’ all things an office with cubicles holding desks & spin chairs in front o’ them & a water cooler only a meter ’way from them.

{ Clearly my armchair theorizing ’bout Spector has turned out all wrong }.

{ I have the creeping suspicion that this is someone else’s apartment & that its owner or owners would be less nonchalant ’bout me trespassing as Spector }.

{ I doubt whoe’er owns this will know, & if they do, I can ’splain. I still can’t open Spector’s door, so there’s no use going back down there. My best bet is finding the front door o’ this office & hoping it wasn’t as asininely designed as Spector’s. Jesus, this is why I ne’er have time to accomplish anything — if it’s not being too lazy or unable to keep myself focused, it’s wasting hours stuck on wrong buses on wrong streets or stuck in the wrong apartment }.

{ There isn’t any door in here — wait, ¿what? }.

As Nasrin looked mo’ closely @ the cubicles covering the other side o’ the room, they noticed that 1 had both an opening on the side closest to them & ’nother on the back end.

{ ¿What’s the point in putting people in cubicles if you make them open to other peoples’ cubicles? }.

{ Probably a lazy cost-cutting design. ¿Who cares? Let’s just hurry out o’ here }.

But Nasrin noticed something odd & let this curiosity steal their attention for a moment: they craned their neck so they could see the right wall o’ the rightmost cubicle, which was gainst the right wall, & saw that it opened up to what looked like yet ’nother open cubicle — which meant that this room wasn’t a rectangle, but some mo’ complex shape, probably an octagon or a + sign.

Since it didn’t seem to detour into weird side space, Nasrin went into the leftmost cubicle & went straight thru, sidling while trying to avoid touching anything as much as possible, which was soon proven impossible when they found that the 2nd cubicle had its chair wide out, covering the whole space.

{ I’m sure a hair o’ mine’s fallen in, so I doubt it matters if I get my fingerprints on anything }, they thought as they pushed the chair back into its desk.

But when they got round the chair, they found that there was no opening on that wall; ’stead, looking round, they found an opening on both side walls.

{ ¿A fucking maze? That ought to work wonders for worker efficiency }.

Since they was already on the right side, they went down it, only to find both its split paths end in dead ends. They retraced their way back to the 1st fork & then went round to the left side. After 1 mo’ dead end, they finally found the path to the other side, only to find that ’twas a dead end o’ a different kind, just with regular domestic plaster rather than whate’er material cubicle walls were made o’.

{ This is ridiculous. I’d have a better chance o’ clawing my way out thru the wall }.

{ Maybe Spector’s come back now. I may as well check }.

So Nasrin retraced their way back thru the cubicle maze & down the ladder, only to find, ’pon reaching the bottom, that Spector’s room had completely changed: now ’stead o’ a sparsely-furnished room ’bout 2.5m2 with cheap plaster walls they found themself in a much longer lobby with red carpet stretching from 1 end to the other & the walls, which had decorative blue-&-white-striped wallpaper, were littered with doors, potted plants, &… windows showing the dark blue sky sprinkled with light lines o’ rain. Nasrin ran up to the closest window & looked out it only to see, to their shock, that the ground appeared to be many floors below, so high up that they could see the top o’ a cherryblossom.

{ All right, there are 2 explanations for this: 1. I am so out o’ it that I somehow missed climbing multiple floors up from below ground level; 2. I have entered an apartment created by Lovecraft that can break the laws o’ space }.

{ ¿How will I e’er leave this apartment if any door can just warp me to anywhere from underground to 80 floors ’bove ground? }.

{ ¿If I tried calling 9/11 & asking them to break in & rescue me would they be able to find me? ¿How would they react if they ran into this absurdity? }.

Then they remembered that they’d brought their transportation needle with them, as they had considered showing it to Spector.

{ That’s a terrible idea. I have no idea how humans’ location coding works — & considering how complex humans’ coding is, it’s probably not just a simple variable. I haven’t e’en gotten a chance to test it on an animal }, the unexpressed reason for this latter negligence due largely to Nasrin having ’bout just as much moral qualms with endangering animals with their crazy experiments as people.

Nasrin stared down the window’s height ’gain & wondered to themself, { ¿Could I open this window & climb down without killing myself? }.
