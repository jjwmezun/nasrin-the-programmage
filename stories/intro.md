In building B4 o’ an apartment complex in the district o’ International in the obscure island city-state o’ Boskeopolis there dwelled a mysterious figure, sitting in their black bewheeled chair under the orange light o’ their lamp, listening the the tapping rain & howling trains o’ October, their thin fingers typing on their keyboard, only stopping e’ery now & then to peel open a Reeses Ghost to take a bite o’ it or raise their pumpkinfaced mug to drink black tea or to pet or scratch the chin o’ their black cat, Sabbath, or to pull their headphone cord out o’ Sabbath’s mouth, their eyes as rough as rocks ’hind the lavendertinted panes o’ their glasses as they stared @ the arcane white symbols scattered ’cross the black void like stars in space, checking that they were correct & that a devilish fugue had not snuck a toxic spell into their terminal.

{ This is the correct branch. You just checked it }.

{ These changes all look good — these are autogenerated, I don’t need to check them }.

& with their soul assured, they cast the following 3 spells:

git add .
git commit -m 'Implement for bulb light'
git push

& with the final push o’ the return key, they stretched their legs out, rolling their black bewheeled chair backward, & began turning their stiff neck left & right while holding the back o’ their neck with their hands, yawning @ the #s in the clock in the bottom corner o’ their screen telling them ’twas the hour o’ the ox.

{ Shit, I have to work tomorrow }.

& so, Nasrin the Programmage, laid down on their ghostsheets, covered themself with their 5 layers o’ blankets, & drifted off to sleep with the expectation that tomorrow would just be an ordinary day.

&, yeah, they were pretty much right, ’cept for their bus being a few minutes late & their normal work on the new 5-Card app that probably wasn’t going to be released being interrupted for a half hour or so by ’nother client ambushing them with their sudden need for help with their website’s “SSL” certificate ( truly TLS ) needing to be renewed.

The day after, tho, they found themselves lost in a forest where e’ery tree’s leaves were made o’ black bats. But that is a story for ’nother night — it’s late here, too, & I also have to work tomorrow.
