# & I Still Believe that I Cannot Be Saved

## I.

{ Maybe you imagined it }.

No, they knew they’d seen it.

What surprised them most was how mild their fear was as they sat there gripping their blankets, staring @ some empty wall, shadowy under the lowly lamp light. ’Twas only now that they realized how long that wall had followed them, how many memories it kept for them.

{ You can’t stay up all night. I already have trouble staying ’wake in school as is }.

{ You knew this day would come. You can’t be surprised }.

## II.

<Dad, I think I saw a rat>.

Without turning ’way from the family computer, their father said, <Enjoy your new pet>.

<¿Can’t rats give diseases?>, Nasrin said with the queasiness o’ someone who caught puke-e’ery-half-hour flus a’least once a year.

<If you’re still living in the middle ages, yes>.

They heard the voice o’ their older brother, Amin, pop in: <Let me get my pellet gun & I’ll take care o’ it>.

Suddenly, father’s expression turned stern.

<No guns in this house — not e’en pellet guns. ¿What are you, a hillbilly?>.

<Come on, I’m just protecting my li’l sister>.

But e’en with their fears o’ being bitten & dying o’ some obscure disease, Nasrin frowned @ the prospect o’ any rat being shot dead. Worse, they feared they’d accidentally fall into their brother’s fire & lose an eye or something.

<You’re not nearly white ’nough to use that ’scuse, LaPierre>, their father said. <She probably just imagined it, anyway. Now stop bugging me, both o’ you; I have busy work I need to do — you know, protecting us from the much realer threat o’ living under a bridge ’cause I can’t pay rent>.

So Nasrin slunk back to “their room”, which was really just the livingroom, with a guilty glumness, but not ’nough o’ 1 to keep them from continuing their pretend *Donkey Kong Country* knock-off, composed not from assembly code but from action figures o’ an armored panda human & pimpled frog man in a Hawaiian shirt & beach shorts & a dusty yellowing keyboard plugged into thin air. As they played they saw the rat skitter by ’gain & tied it into their game as a rare instakill enemy.

## III.

That night the rats had a game o’ their own.

Nasrin woke to the sound o’ loud scurrying & knotted their blanket in their fingers when they saw not 1 rat, but a whole ring o’ them round their couch bed, wandering this way & that, each step random like an RPG NPC.

Then they saw a few surround a teddy turtle, pick it up ’bove their heads as if ’twere crowd surfing, & then carry it ’way inside a hole in the wall so small, they were surprised such large rats could fit thru it.

They sat there with their mind buzzing with indecision, ’fraid o’ both the rats stealing all their toys ’way if they sat there & ’fraid o’ being attacked themself if they dared so much as breathe mo’ heavily.

{ If I run fast ’nough, I could maybe make it to father’s room ’fore they notice me & wake dad up }.

{ He’ll probably be annoyed. ¿But what other choice do I have? }.

But then they pulled the blanket mo’ closely to themself. { Maybe it’s not worth it. I mean… they’re just toys }. Nasrin said this with a deep frown full o’ the memories o’ all the ventures the characters that dwelled in these toys went thru — the only characters they knew, truly.

{ ’Sides, it’s ’bout mo’ than the toys: } — tho in the deepest corners o’ Nasrin’s mind they acknowledged that the toys did occupy a large space — { if I don’t stop them while I have a chance, they’ll ’ventually come & get me }.

So they took a deep breath, & then leapt out o’ bed & raced for the stairs. & by that, I mean they tripped on the bedsheet still wrapped round an ankle, causing them to tumble to the thick carpet with a booming thump.

Nasrin’s heart drummed faster than a fan as they sat up & saw the rats all turn toward them with eyes glowing illishly green e’en in the dark, so brightly that it lit up almost the whole room with a radioactive cast, which now felt like a spotlight on Nasrin.

{ If there’s any chance to live, it’s by acting… ¡now! }.

The fear was ’nough to break thru Nasrin’s natural inclination toward paralysis & compel them to jump to their feet & run to the stairs. They heard sour hisses as they reached it, but was able to keep themself from looking back & put all their effort into climbing up the stairs & up to father’s door. With the hope that none could fit under the door, they closed it ’hind them as they entered.

Tho their ultimate goal was to wake father, they didn’t have it in them to shout for him to wake up, but waited till they were right next to him to shake him roughly — well, roughly for them — & whisper, <Dad…>, repeatedly.

He mumbled incoherently for a few seconds, & then mumbled a mo’ coherent, <¿What? ¿What now?>.

<¡The rats! ¡There’s, there’s a lot o’ them! ¡I saw some taking some o’ my toys ’way & they have glowing eyes!>, Nasrin said in an exclaimed whisper.

Their father whispered, too, but mo’ loudly, <Damn it, Nas, that’s just a nightmare. You should know better than this>.

<No, I saw it, I swear>, Nasrin whispered mo’ urgently.

{ ¿Why didn’t I expect him not to believe me, ’specially when he didn’t before? ¿Doesn’t this happen all the time in cartoons? }.

<Mmm hmm. I’ll go to sleep & they’ll go ’way>, their father murmured as he turned ’way from them.

Nasrin froze. Tho part o’ them wanted to reach out & shake him ’gain, thinking he just had to do something, the sturdier part o’ them realized there was no use. They shivered as it hammered in their mind that they would have to deal with the rats themself, that ’twas likely they were going to be killed & there was nothing they could do to stop it.

## IV.

But they were still ’live the next morn, where they found themself woken in a curled position on the floor o’ their father’s room. They looked up @ their father’s face, strange-looking with his glassesless shrunken eyes & hairy chin. But they easily recognized the way he shook it slowly, back & forth.

<Lemme guess: it’s the rats ’gain>.

Nasrin nodded slowly.

Their father rubbed his face. <¿& how long will this go on?>.

<Till you do something ’bout it>, Nasrin retorted in a mousy mumble o’ morning grumpiness.

<¿What?>, their father mumbled himself.

But Nasrin felt the useless grumpiness melt & didn’t see the point in saying it ’gain; so they simply said, <Nothing. Sorry>, & slowly rose to their feet & walked out.

## V.

That night, as they were putting games ’way, they noticed a rat pop its head out o’ a hole & glare @ them. This caused them to freeze; but that ice was shattered into shivering crystals when they heard a slithery voice emit from it:

<We know you’re our enemy. & our enemy always falls>.

Then it popped its head back in, leaving Nasrin to sit there with a sudden stomach ache.

## VI.

Nasrin spent the rest o’ that night not sleeping, but drenching the corner o’ their couch bed with tears as they tried to squeeze themself into it. Years younger they imagined there lived a world that had an infinite ’mount o’ everything in there; how they wished they could come inside now.

Then they felt a hand clutch their arm softly. <¿Nas?>, whispered the voice o’ their brother. Tho they sniffed ’way their tears, they didn’t want to turn ’way from their corner.

<You’re not still scared o’ those rats, ¿are you?>.

Nasrin murmured something impossible for e’en them to hear.

Then they heard his whispering words much closer to their ear:

<Listen, father has to go to some convention next Friday night. I’ll take care o’ those rats then>.

## VII.

Nasrin didn’t dare watch as their brother “took care” o’ the rats. But no matter how much they covered their ears with their hands or covered their whole self with their blanket, their ears couldn’t ’scape the sharp pings & the sharper hissing screams that followed, nor the images o’ foggy white souls stretching as they rose from the bloody gray bodies toward the abyss that such sounds inspired.

After what felt like an agonizing eternity, they heard the pings & screams taper off, followed by their brother’s cheerful voice: <That should be the last 1. Now I’d better clean these up ’fore dad gets home>.

Nasrin forced themself to throw the blanket off & look @ the warzone o’ rat corpses. Tho they expected a sea o’ blood, they found the dry, shrunken carcasses they saw e’en mo’ sad.

But they forced themself to their feet & helped their brother pick up those wiry-haired mounds o’ cold meat & toss them into the grocery-store bag he set to the side, their jaw rigidly shut to stop the bile rising in the back o’ their throat, their head turned from an imagined stench o’ evil, for their nose was so stuffed that they couldn’t smell anything. This lasted all o’ a minute or so before their brother told them that they didn’t have to worry ’bout picking the rats up & that he would take care o’ it, in which case Nasrin went & washed their hands & buried their face in the couch ’gain.

## VIII.

The ensuing days were almost worse. Nasrin could still hear the rats’ death cries ring thru their ears, could still see their misshapen corpses in their nightmares. But they forced themself to keep all the boiling upset from leaking out for fear o’ showing ungratefulness to their brother, who saved their life, after all — or worse, to clue their father in on what happened & possibly betray their brother e’en mo’ by getting him in trouble.

Their fears only worsened 1 night when they saw what they thought was their guilty imagination, but was, they realized, a true rat, poking its head out o’ a hole with an angry eye now glowing violent red.

It took full effort to hold in a scream from erupting with both hands.

But all the rat did was say to them in a deep tone o’ bitter medicine, <Enjoy your peace for now, you butcherous bitch. Your brother won’t be there to kill for you fore’er, & when he’s gone…>. The rat opened its mouth — the 1st time they’d seen 1 do so — & revealed a large, yellow-tipped fang.

Then it turned back into its hole, & they didn’t see it, nor ’nother, ’gain for years.

## IX.

Those years ended today. Nasrin, now 16 ’stead o’ 11, & Amin, indeed, was off somewhere they knew not; & here Nasrin was sitting in bed, the bed that used to be Amin’s in the bedroom that used to be his, staring calmly @ the rats scurrying out o’ the hole, 1 by 1, the fear creeping up on them like a sniffling cold growing into a full-fevered flu — a fear only let out thru subtle trembles o’ their arms. It wasn’t that they couldn’t see any reason to fear the thousand nooses hanging in front o’ them with no sign o’ ’scape, so much as their confusion & uncertainty holding back their reaction.

{ They haven’t killed me yet… ¿What are they waiting for? }.

{ If they give me just 1 day, I may be saved… }.

As if responding themselves, the rats scurried back into the hole — all but a much larger rat with knotted graying fur with a chunk missing, as well as pieces o’ its ear & the end o’ its tail. Only 1 o’ its eyes glowed green, while the other was dead black.

Nasrin was surprised to recognize a rat after mo’ than 5 years, but they did.

<I hope you enjoyed your happy days carelessly getting ’way with murder; ’course, now they’re o’er>,  the rat’s voice, much raspier than before, said before popping into its hole.

They didn’t sleep that night, didn’t see a use. They could sleep as long as they wanted after they saved their life. For now, they clicked on the light, with the inkling that the rats didn’t like it, & might be mo’ likely to keep back, & then they spent half the night planning & half the night going o’er all their favorite memories.

## X.

’Pon coming home from school the next day — for ’course the rats wouldn’t wait before a weekend to bother them — they dug thru the garage, only to be disheartened when they couldn’t find what they were looking for.

They stood there, half in the shadow o’ the garage & half in the hot late afternoon sunshine, for the garage light didn’t work anymo’. ’Cause o’ this, they had to light the dark half with a lighter they found ’mong the junk — probably Amin’s.

{ I definitely don’t have ’nough to afford 1 o’ my own, nor would I know where to buy 1… }.

{ ¿Could I just run ’way? ¿Could the rats follow me out in the city? }.

{ ¿Dare I try finding out? }.

They began pacing the garage, eyes darting ’mong much o’ the useless junk they kept in there, such as the ol’ toys they were so worried ’bout the rats taking, now collecting dust & dirt stains. They kept glancing back @ the clock on their phone & saw the minutes climbing up to night like spiders.

They grasped their forehead. How they wished they could be in their bed, curled in warm blankets with just the empty darkness round them.

{ ¡I don’t have time to waffle! ¡I have to do something! }.

They began pacing round ’gain, only to trip o’er a pile o’ fishing rods — { ¡when did anyone in this family e’er go anywhere close to fishing? } — hidden in the shadows.

In the exhaustion & the pain in their shin that throbbed like red lights that flashed on & off, on & off, they began to think, { Maybe I deserve to die… I did cause so many o’ them to die… & they’re clearly intelligent creatures, too, probably smarter than I am, actually. What I did was probably genocide }.

Then a thousand thoughts shot thru their mind: { ¿What was I s’posed to do? ¡They were gonna kill me! ¡’Twas Amin who did it! ¿How’s it my fault I was so stupid as a 10 or 11 or whatever year ol’? }.

{ ¡Augh! ¡Why can’t everything just leave me ’lone for once? }.

In a fury, Nasrin began kicking shit round & grunting, fueled by the absence o’ their father, @ ’nother stupid convention, — a clever bit o’ timing for those rats, such innocent rats — fueled e’en mo’ by their oft hurting themself on the hardness o’ some o’ the objects they attacked.

{ ¡Augh! ¡I can’t fucking believe I’m going to die ’cause we have all this useless shit & not the 1 fucking thing I need! }.

’Mong the things they ’specially aimed their feet @ were the stupid fishing rods, which they kicked half a meter ’way.

Then they stopped with their leg hanging in the air.

There they saw, lying where the fishing rods had been before, Amin’s pellet gun.

## XI.

Nasrin found out that their question o’ what to do after they were convinced the pellet gun had ample ammo & that they could use it halfway competently was useless: so early had they seen the sun go down, leaving ’hind an increasingly cloudy grayness that began to leak rain.

{ There’s no avoiding it. Might as well get it o’er with }.

They clutched the pellet gun to their chest like a security blanket, took a deep breath, & then opened the door back into the kitchen.

## XII.

What scared Nasrin most wasn’t the sight o’ the rats, but still not seeing them after o’er an hour waiting in their bedroom in the dark.

{ ¿Can they see me? ¿Are they just going to wait till I let my guard down, — till I inevitably fall asleep — & then kill me when I can’t do anything? }.

Part o’ Nasrin thought this seemed too merciful, to kill them in their sleep, for creatures who so emphasized their thirst for vengeance; but then they realized they could just tie them up while they slept & then wake them up for the fun…

& then Nasrin’s mind filled with all the ways they could destroy them: tearing the skin off their with those sharp teeth… perhaps with some eye-gouging…

Nasrin began to claw @ their own face in reaction to such itchiness. Despite having gone to the bathroom just before coming into their room for just such reasons, their bladder already felt like ’twas bursting with a gallon o’ water.

{ ¡What’s taking so long to get here? ¡Hurry up already! }.

{ ¡I’m such an idiot! ¿Why didn’t I think to hide the gun in here — maybe under my mattress — while ’twas still day, when they were unlikely to see me? ¡Such simple insight could’ve kept me ’live! }.

But the sickness that struck them straight to their stomach made them rethink their desire to live.

{ ¡I still have those pills! ¡They won’t be able to harm a nerve o’ me if I’m already out o’ here! }.

They reached under their mattress for the bottle, only to freeze when they saw green light emerge from their side. They put their hands back onto their pellet gun & slid it just under them.

<Murderous witch, ¿are you ready? ¿Any last words?>.

Nasrin said nothing. They only sat there with a grim frown, their knees shaking o’er the hard, blocky gun.

<¿Nothing? You know, I’ve ne’er heard a single word from you. ¡E’en the call to have us murdered was so stealthy! ¿’Bove talking to us?>.

Nasrin only shook their head. E’en in front o’ rats they felt the words twist into dust on the way from their mind to their mouth.

The rat cackled. <If you says so…>.

Nasrin saw a million green eyes pop round them.

{ ¡Now! }.

They jumped out from under their sheets, aimed the pellet gun @ the 1st rat they saw, & began popping out pellets, slowly revolving in a circle, bobbing their gun up & down to get any uneven rats.

@ 1st the rats fell 1 by 1 with screeches they still remembered from when they were 11. But then they heard the lead rat cry out, <¡This is our only chance! ¿Remember what happened last time? ¡Better to die fighting!>.

Then the rats pounced forward together like the beads o’ a necklace tightening round a neck, & before Nasrin could shoot them all, the rats reached them, 1st 1 biting their on the hand, while the others clawed & bit all round them till they covered their like huge termites. Despite the sharp pain shooting all round their nervous system, they kept their grip on the gun & continued shooting @ rats while they kicked @ the others.

Then they heard the ¡pew!s o’ the pellet gun become empty clicks.

By this point the rats had them on the floor. Nasrin began to feel woozy from the shock o’ the pain, & figured they would pass out soon.

They looked round & stopped their eyes on the dresser. They reached out & pulled out the bottom drawer, & then pulled on the bottom bar o’ the dresser with full strength, causing it to slowly slide forward, & then shook it.

<¡C’mon! ¡C’mon!>, they shouted.

Then it fell: the lighter. They grabbed it & clicked it on, releasing a bulb-shaped flame that combined with the rat’s green eyes to make the room look mo’ festive, o’ all things.

But they didn’t aim the flame @ any o’ the rats in particular, but pressed it to their own shirt sleeve, & then placed ’nother flame on their sweat pants. They kept placing flame after flame on them, causing mo’ & mo’ rats to jump back, standing half a meter ’way, staring @ them. They themself had become so numb to the constant bites & scratches o’ the rats that the deep burns o’ all the flames hardly seemed different. If anything, they mo’ noticed the chilliness o’ the extra air seeping into the hole after hole being built into their apparel.

The lead rat, who hopped back ’mong most the others, said, <¿Decide to do yourself in?>.

When the last rat left, they leapt to their feet & ran out o’ the room. As they neared the bathroom, they slowed, only to speed past after remembering the weather.

They shoved their way outside into the dosing rain, not e’en stopping from the jolting relief o’ the soft coldness on their burns & wounds, & yanked open the garage. Luckily, it took them no time @ all to find what they were looking for this time, as well as a blow torch much better than the pitiful lighter.

They stormed back inside with sloshing footsteps, lugging the blow torch in 1 arm & the can o’ gasoline in the other.

<¿Back already, witch?>, said a voice from nowhere.

They didn’t respond. They stomped straight up the stairs, tho their eyes did dart all round them for signs o’ early rats. None appeared.

{ They can see you. They know what you’re going to do, & they’ll just run. You can’t beat them. They’re smarter than you. You can’t beat them & they’ll destroy you & there’s nothing you can do }.

But their feet moved as if on automatic, only to stop inside their bedroom. They shut the door & waited, revolving round the room. They still saw no rats.

<¿& what do you plan to do with those? ¿Catch us?>.

Nasrin felt such a jolt o’ pleasure. They gasped as if they’d ne’er breathed before. { ¡I’m saved! }.

They stopped in front o’ the rat hole, & without letting their face o’ fury fall, demanded quietly, <Come out>.

The rats laughed, so many tiny noises that poked & prodded such small dregs o’ consciousness they had remaining. They bit inside their mouth to keep themself aware.

<We wouldn’t want to ruin your last moments: they look so fruitful>, said the lead rat.

Nasrin growled, & then threw the gas can on the ground. They glanced down with a held heart to see the spread o’ its liquid… { ¡Yes! }. It went into the rat hole.

They held their breath. { OK… The timing has to be perfect… }.

<You humans think you’re so intelligent, but you’re actually some o’ the most insipid creatures… ¿You truly think you’ll trick us into drinking poison like the average rodents? ¿Have you no pattern recognition?>.

Nasrin rammed the torch forward as they clicked it on, causing a fire to burst from its mouth & quickly spread ’cross the lake o’ gas into the hole.

Then Nasrin’s ears were filled in surround sound with screams e’en louder & piercing than they’d remembered as a preteen.

Then they noticed the flames rise thru the wall, & then spread out round the room & out into the ceiling & floor. The slightly orangish blackness began to quickly gray in clouds o’ smoke. They raced for the door & opened it out into the rest o’ the house with coughs, only to see the flames spreading ’cross the rest o’ the house. There they saw rats darting back & forth & in seemingly random directions, only for all o’ them to ’ventually be caught & disappeared by the long tentacles o’ the fire.

They ran down the stairs & out the front door, gasping in the fresh air as the smoke billowed o’er them to join the rainy clouds. They walked round the house, & then stopped ’pon a point out from which lines o’ rats spread. They walked right up to the point, bent down, & sprayed fire down into it, causing the hissy screams to explode in volume. Tho some rats still zipped out, the # was much fewer than before, & e’en many o’ them only managed to get a meter or so ’way before collapsing, soon after revealed to be nothing mo’ than black husks under curtains o’ fire pulled back by the rain.

After a few minutes, the screams died down, leaving just the crackling firepower o’ the fire vs. the rain. After a few mo’ minutes o’ silence, Nasrin rose to their feet, walked a few steps ’way, & dropped the torch onto the dirt. They were hunched o’er. Only now did they notice the buzz o’ exhaustion & their still-untreated wounds. Pain woke up ’long their whole body ’gain.

{ I failed… I know some rats ’scaped, & they’ll want revenge e’en mo’ now… }.

{ ¡& the house! ¿How explain that? If not prison, a’least insane asylum fore’er… Eternal lockdown… Eternal torture… }.

{ I can’t stay ’wake. But if I collapse here, the rats’ll come back… }.

They turned back to the house & stared @ it with blurry eyes, staring not so much @ the bright flames as the translucent smoke, which looked now as soft as pillows, as warm as blankets.

They jumped when they heard a piercing siren quickly grow louder, & turned back to see a red blinking truck rush up the street, & then stop just before them. & as they numbly saw people in yellow suits climb out, they knew ’twas too late to be saved.
