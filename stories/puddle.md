Nasrin made a mistake that Saturday morn, just after waking up: they made the mistake o’ letting themself get carried ’way by the opium of optimism that today would be a peaceful, productive day where they might finish off most o’ their books, only to have that popped like a bubble ’pon stepping into the kitchen to boil tea & being greeted by a trespassing puddle, which was mo’ like a lake, spreading all o’er their kitchen floor from under the dishwasher like an imperialist empire — & after just washing their slippers, just showering, & wearing their favorite purple eye T-shirt & plaid dark gray sweat pants, too. ’Twas always a fun surprise to see what new contraption would break down in the lovely slum in which they paid 40,000₧ every month to live. They searched round their apartment for whate’er towels they could find & laid them on the puddle, only for them to be devoured from the inside by the invading water till they became blobs o’ goop while Nasrin’s new bay remained @ bay.

They wandered their livingroom/diningroom/bedroom/office for a mop for minutes, bewilderingly unable to find it in such a small space, only to remember that they kept leaving it in the bathtub, always reminding them on 1st stepping in to every shower to take it out, only to always forget ’pon stepping out. They then rolled the weird plastic trolley with which the mop was bought — a smaller bucket that spun when the bottom petal was stepped on to dry the mop & a lower bucket to keep water — & began wiping up water & spinning the water out o’ it & into the lower bucket, gradually filling it with water that now looked brownish. But no matter how long they sponged up & squeezed, the lake wouldn’t drain, but just sloshed back sullenly into place a moment after.

So Nasrin did what they usually did: they accepted that there was nothing they could do & that they would have to adjust their life round their new roommate. They stepped onto 1 o’ the clumps o’ seaweed that was formerly a towel, frowning deeply as they felt their feet get wet as the water slipped thru the sole o’ their slipper as if it weren’t e’en there, & carried out their normal morning task o’ filling their teapot with water & putting it on the stove. Then they left the kitchen, wiping the wet soles o’ their slippers on the carpet, & then sat down on their mattress & read a few haiku as they waited for the kettle to boil. After a few minutes, they heard their kettle’s familiar whistle call, & rose with their mug in hand.

Howe’er, as they stepped onto the towel this time, they felt it suddenly sink half a meter or so, so that they was now knee-down into the puddle. They looked down, heart pounding @ such abrupt movement, wondering how the puddle e’en sunk so deep. They grasped their hands round the front edge o’ the stove as they felt the puddle’s forces try to suck their in mo’. They looked round themself & saw the puddle expand e’en further, now out into the livingroom. Their hands shook as they struggled to hold onto the increasing strength o’ this puddle’s vaccuum, only to feel to their horror the stove start to gradually bend downward. Then they heard a hard rattling & felt a sudden burning hot sensation in their right hand & flung it off the oven by reflex. They looked o’er & saw that the kettle had been flung off its place on the stove & was now falling into the puddle & then drowning in it. Before they could think ’bout it, their left hand was pulled off the oven by the force & they was suddenly submerged into the puddle.

If Nasrin were an ordinary person, they would’ve drowned soon after. For once fortune favoring them, it turned out that they were a programmage, capable o’ bending the laws o’ physics & reality to their will… given the time & skills to figure out reality’s arcane languages. That disclaimer always limited them. Howe’er, they had already developed oxygenated bubbles in preparation for sitting on the beach — for they were always paranoid o’ a particularly large wave jumping up & sucking them in just like this puddle — & so they brought out their Pumpkin π wand & wrapped a bubble round their head, leaving them coughing up water with already aching lungs & with rashlike burning eyes that they, unfortunately, couldn’t rub with their hands, but a’least able to fill their lungs with the oxygen they so craved.

As the water dried & dripped out o’ their eyes, they gradually regained the ability to see & saw before them a wide-open ocean — albeit one with a dank pewter cast rather than blue.
